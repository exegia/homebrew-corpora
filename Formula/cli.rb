# corpora — terminal conversion CLI, hosted in this repo (src/corpora_cli).
#
# The formula installs the corpora-cli package into its own virtualenv with
# pip resolving the (many) Python dependencies — corpora-py and everything
# under it — from PyPI, rather than vendoring every dependency as a Homebrew
# resource stanza: this is a personal tap, and the dependency closure
# (text-fabric, context-fabric, lxml, fastapi, ...) would be unmaintainable
# as resources.
#
# `url` points at this repo's own release-tag tarball; the tag's VERSION
# file is the package version (hatch reads it), so the tarball builds the
# exact released wheel (version is inferred from the tag URL — an explicit
# stanza fails `brew audit` as redundant). The bump workflow
# (.github/workflows/bump.yml) rewrites url/sha256 on each corpora-cli
# release tag. `corpora-api` and `cf-mcp` still come from the corpora-py
# dependency's entry points.
